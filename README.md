# MultiplayerConnect4Client
A simple terminal-based multiplayer Connect 4 using the WinSock2 API. This is my first try at using sockets especially in C 

Super buggy atm
- Loser's game crashes immediately upon losing and winner's game doesn't know it won
- Weird behavior/crashes when connecting to the server
